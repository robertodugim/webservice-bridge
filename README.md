Restfull WebService JSON/JSONP fitting as a bridge to a Extenal API

The cliente wanted a site with a lntegration to an external API
It is a very simple problem if you use jsonp and ajax, but I had the issues bellow:
* API and API Server could not be modified or reached by the cliente or I at that moment
* API only sent responses in JSON.
* The API Server did not allow cross-browser requests

In order to fix those issues and make the integration that WebService Bridge was created.
